It’s no surprise that a blogger with 180,000 followers would be drawn to a watch by its social media profile.
“When Hublot took over a whole hotel in Brazil for the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and turned it into a Hublot hotel and had fun activities every day, I followed it on social media and thought it was brilliant,” Zeynab El Helw recalled. “And Hublot was the first brand I know of to have a regional social media profile with original images, using Arabic. I really liked that.”
There’s another reason the 30-year-old favors Hublot: The brand has what she calls “street-style chic.” She bought its Big Bang Steel Diamonds watch because “it has a rubber strap, which makes it casual, but it’s combined with elegant diamonds on the bezel.”
That high/low mix is the story of her life. She grew up in London, was trained in piano and flute, graduated from Central St. Martins and then earned a master’s degree in marketing and a second master’s in international business management. She moved to Dubai, where she still lives, and worked until May for Dior, directing its marketing for the Middle East, Africa and Turkey. All pretty classic.
Then there’s her other side: “I used to borrow my brothers’ oversized hoodies and ripped T-shirts,” she said. She also “wrote music and created an R&B band called X-Pose.”
In 2014 she started Fashion Pirate, an online blog and boutique “to develop something on my own,” curating items with a style she calls “street glam.”
As the site has grown, she’s bought herself a second Hublot for “motivation,” a Big Bang Linen Blue. “I think using linen on the strap and dial makes the watch one-of-a-kind,’’ she said. “It’s so fresh.” Just what a stylish pirate needs.
