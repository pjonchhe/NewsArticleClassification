Blame Winter Storm Niko, the exodus of some of New York’s most prominent designers to other cities and the unforgiving glare of social media. But there was less fun to go around this Fashion Week.
Things got off to a rough start last Thursday, when a storm led to the cancellation of some parties, including a reception at the Museum at F.I.T.
It didn’t help that Tommy Hilfiger decamped for Los Angeles’s Venice Beach, Rachel Comey took her dinner show to an art gallery in downtown Los Angeles and Rodarte, a reliable purveyor of free beer and raucous times, fled to Paris.
For the designers who stayed, there seems to be a growing realization that parties have become just another promotional vehicle. Brands like Rag & Bone and Baja East ditched the after-party, folding the drinking, dancing and Snapchatting into their shows.
Alexander Wang might have understood this best with his highly conceptual No After-Party show, with beer kegs and disco lights. Party hopefuls were glued to their Instagram feeds in case a secret party materialized. (It didn’t.)
That is not to say fun wasn’t had. Of the 50 invitations received, we dragged ourselves to some 20 parties this past week.
Highlights included amfAR’s annual kickoff gala at Cipriani Wall Street, where Scarlett Johansson and Donatella Versace were honored. Raf Simons took a victory lap of sorts on the dance floor after his well-received debut show for Calvin Klein. Philipp Plein turned the New York Public Library into a late-night rave.
And although Opening Ceremony opted for a New York City Ballet production last month in lieu of a show, Humberto Leon, one of the its founders, held a party anyway, teaming up with the photographer Ryan McGinley to bring back the popular gay party, B. East on the Lower East Side.
“This is just a fun party,” Mr. Leon said. “It’s not a Fashion Week” party. It’s for our friends.”
